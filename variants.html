        These are not official. They’re just things people do once you put traps in a pile.

      <h2>Major variants</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Trap Tower</h2>
        <p>
          The original game: build the tallest freestanding structure using only loaded
          mousetraps.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Trap Pile (Mousetrap Jenga)</h2>
        <p>
          Players take turns placing loaded traps on a plate. If anything goes off, you
          replace it. The game ends when someone sets off the pile.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="trap-pile.html">Read the rules →</a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Other variants</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Table Turns (Two-Touch Rule)</h2>
        <p>
          A smaller group takes turns placing loaded mousetraps on a small table.
          The only constraint: each new trap must touch at least two others.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Players take turns placing a single loaded trap</li>
          <li>Each new trap must touch at least two existing traps</li>
          <li>The structure grows outward and upward until it doesn’t</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We haven’t tested this version as thoroughly, but the two-touch constraint creates
          interesting placement decisions and rapid failures.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Timed Relays</h2>
        <p>
          Same goal as Trap Tower, but teammates can only place traps during a short “turn window”
          (e.g., 10 seconds), then rotate. It’s less about engineering and more about panic.
        </p>
        <p class="subtle">
          (If you try this, send your timing rules — the details matter.)
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Silence Round</h2>
        <p>
          One minute of the game must be played in total silence. No coaching, no warnings, no
          yelling “WAIT WAIT WAIT.” It’s surprisingly hard.
        </p>

        Have a variant that actually works (or fails spectacularly)?

        Variants are encouraged. If someone claims they “solved” it, they probably didn’t.
