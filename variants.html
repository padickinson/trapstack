        These are not official. They’re just things people do once you put traps in a pile.

        <h2>Table Turns (Two-Touch Rule)</h2>
        <p>
          A smaller group takes turns placing loaded mousetraps on a small table.
          The only constraint: each new trap must touch at least two others.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Players take turns placing a single loaded trap</li>
          <li>Each new trap must touch at least two existing traps</li>
          <li>The structure grows outward and upward until it doesn’t</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We haven’t tested this version as thoroughly, but the two-touch constraint creates
          interesting placement decisions and rapid failures.

        <h2>Timed Relays</h2>
        <p>
          Same goal as Trap Tower, but teammates can only place traps during a short “turn window”
          (e.g., 10 seconds), then rotate. It’s less about engineering and more about panic.
        </p>
        <p class="subtle">
          (If you try this, send your timing rules — the details matter.)

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Silence Round</h2>
        <p>
          One minute of the game must be played in total silence. No coaching, no warnings, no
          yelling “WAIT WAIT WAIT.” It’s surprisingly hard.

        Variants are encouraged. If someone claims they “solved” it, they probably didn’t.
