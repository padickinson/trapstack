      <p>
        Trap Tower is a simple idea that turns out to be much harder than it looks:
        build the tallest freestanding structure you can using only loaded mousetraps.
      </p>

      <p>
        No base. No glue. No tools. Just nerve, coordination, and a growing sense
        that this might have been a bad idea.
      </p>

      <h2>How we played it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Four teams of four slightly inebriated people each</li>
        <li>~100 mousetraps</li>
        <li>Built directly on the floor</li>
        <li>20-minute time limit</li>
        <li>Only rule: build the tallest structure you can using <em>only loaded mousetraps</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We didn’t impose constraints on orientation, symmetry, or design. Anything went, as long
        as the structure was freestanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        After about twenty minutes of attempts, collapses, and aborted placements, the tallest
        structure that actually stood was two layers. One team briefly reached three, but it
        collapsed almost immediately.
      </p>

        <strong>Practical note:</strong><br />
        Not everyone knows how to set a mousetrap. Before starting, it’s worth making sure
        everyone understands how they work.
      </div>

      <h2>Mousetraps</h2>
      <p>
        We used standard Victor-style wooden mousetraps without the plastic bait pedal.
        Approximately one hundred traps was more than enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        The exact set we used was purchased online
        (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victor-M150-12-Metal-Sustainably-Sourced" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon link</a>),
        but many equivalent traps should work similarly.
