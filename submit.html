        If you tried Trap Tower (or invented a variant), I’d love to see it.
        Send whatever you have:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Photos of the setup or the aftermath</li>
        <li>A short write-up of how you played</li>
        <li>Any constraints that made it better (or worse)</li>
        <li>What you’d do differently next time</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        Email:
        <a href="mailto:hello@trapstack.fun">hello@trapstack.fun</a><br />
        <span class="subtle">If you want your submission credited, include the name you’d like displayed.</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        Please don’t send anything that includes people’s faces unless they’re okay being on the site.
        If you’re not sure, crop it or describe it.
