  <h1>TrapStack</h1>
  <div class="tagline">
    A collection of dumb ideas involving spring-loaded traps.
  </div>

  <p>
    TrapStack started at a bachelor party when we stacked loaded mousetraps
    on the floor to see how high we could go.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was chaotic. People flinched. Traps snapped.
    Nobody got hurt. Two layers won.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site documents that original game &mdash; <strong>Trap Tower</strong> &mdash;
    along with variations and bad ideas people have tried since.
  </p>

  <h2>The first game</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Trap Tower</strong> is exactly what it sounds like:
    build the highest freestanding tower you can out of loaded mousetraps.
    No base. No glue. No tools. Just nerve.
  </p>

  <p>
    A full write-up of how we played it (and what surprised us) is coming soon.

      This site is documentation, not advice.
      Mousetraps are mousetraps.
      If you do dumb things, do them responsibly.
