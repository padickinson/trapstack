        TrapStack started at a bachelor party when we stacked loaded mousetraps on the 
        floor to see how high we could go. Traps flew! Fingers were snapped! Grown men
         squealed like little girls! A new classic game was born.

         Check out the games below, and share your triumphs and tragedies.
