      <p>
        TrapStack started at a bachelor party when we stacked loaded mousetraps on the floor
        to see how high we could go.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was chaotic. People flinched. Traps snapped.
        Nobody got hurt. Two layers won.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is a home for that original game (Trap Tower) and any variations or bad ideas
        people have tried since. The goal isn’t fairness. It’s stories.

          Build the tallest freestanding structure you can using only loaded mousetraps.
          No base. No glue. No tools. Just nerve.

        <p>
          Some people prefer turn-taking constraints, table play, or rules that force traps to
          touch multiple neighbors. Variants are encouraged.

        This site documents how people play these games. It is not advice.
        Mousetraps are mousetraps. If you do dumb things, do them responsibly.
