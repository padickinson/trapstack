<h1>TrapStack</h1>

<p><em>A collection of dumb ideas involving spring-loaded traps.</em></p>

<p>
TrapStack started at a bachelor party when we stacked loaded mousetraps
on the floor to see how high we could go.
</p>

<p>
It was chaotic. People flinched. Traps snapped.
Nobody got hurt. Two layers won.
</p>

<p>
This site documents the original game (Trap Tower) and
variations people have tried since.
</p>

  <p>
    This is not advice. Mousetraps are mousetraps.
    If you do dumb things, do them responsibly.
